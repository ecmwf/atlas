  /** @brief YAKL Pool allocator class.
    *
    * Growable pool allocator for efficient frequent allocations and deallocations.
    * User determines allocation, free, initial pool size, additional pool size, and other pool allocator
    * characteristics upon initiailization.
    *
    * Once existing pools run out of memory, additional pools are create. Each pool is based on a simple
    * linear search for free slots that is as efficient in memory usage as possible. While search time is
    * linear rather than log in complexity, allocations and frees are typically overlapped with kernel execution.
    *
    * Gator objects **are thread safe** for allocate() and free() calls.
