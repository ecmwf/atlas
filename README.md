   >  Atlas: A library for numerical weather prediction and climate modelling

Atlas is a ECMWF library for parallel data-structures supporting unstructured
grids and function spaces, with the aim to investigate alternative more scalable
dynamical core options for Earth System models, and to support modern interpolation
and product generation software

Atlas is predominantly C++ code, with main features available to Fortran codes
through a F2003 interface. It requires some flavour of Unix (such as Linux).
It is known to run on a number of systems, some of which are directly supported
by ECMWF.

Requirements
------------

Tested compilers include:

- GCC 4.9.1, 5.3.0, 6.3.0, 7.2.0
- Intel 15.0.2, 16.0.3, 17, 18
- CCE 8.4.5, 8.5.8, 8.6.2
- PGI-Fortran 17.7 combined with GNU-C/C++ 6.3
- PGI 17.7

Known compilers to fail include:

- PGI-Fortran 17.10, 18.1

Required dependencies:

- CMake --- For use and installation see http://www.cmake.org/
- ecbuild --- ECMWF library of CMake macros
- eckit (with MPI support) --- C++ support library

Recommended dependencies:

- fckit --- For enabling Fortran interfaces
- python (only when Fortran bindings are required)

Optional dependencies:

- gridtools-storage --- For GPU interoperability
- transi --- For enabling IFS spherical harmonics transforms ( not open-source )
- CGAL --- For enabling Delaunay triangulation of unstructured grids
- Eigen3 -- For certain linear algebra operations
- FFTW -- For enabling inverse spherical harmonics transforms (TransLocal)

Installation
------------

Atlas employs an out-of-source build/install based on CMake.

Make sure ecbuild, eckit and fckit are installed and the ecbuild
executable script is found ( `which ecbuild` ). Following environment variables
help the build system to detect the right dependencies:

```bash
# For finding eckit
ECKIT_PATH               # Path to eckit prefix

# For finding fckit
FCKIT_PATH               # Path to fckit prefix
```

Other environment variables that could be required for optional features:

```bash
# For finding gridtools-storage
GRIDTOOLS_STORAGE_PATH   # Path to gridtools-storage prefix

# For finding transi
TRANSI_PATH              # Path to transi prefix

# For finding CGAL
BOOST_ROOT               # Path to Boost prefix
CGAL_DIR                 # Path to directory containing CGALConfig.cmake
Eigen3_DIR               # Path to directory containing Eigen3Config.cmake
FFTW_PATH                # Path to FFTW prefix
```

Now proceed with installation as follows

```bash
# Environment --- Edit as needed
ATLAS_SRC=$(pwd)
ATLAS_BUILD=build
ATLAS_INSTALL=$HOME/local

# 1. Create the build directory:
mkdir $ATLAS_BUILD
cd $ATLAS_BUILD

# 2. Run CMake
ecbuild --prefix=$ATLAS_INSTALL -- $ATLAS_SRC

# 3. Compile / Install
make -j10
make install

# 4. Check installation
$ATLAS_INSTALL/bin/atlas --info
```

Extra flags maybe added to step 2 to fine-tune configuration.

- `--build=DEBUG|RELEASE|BIT` --- Optimisation level
  * DEBUG:   No optimisation (`-O0 -g`)
  * BIT:     Maximum optimisation while remaning bit-reproducible (`-O2 -g`)
  * RELEASE: Maximum optimisation (`-O3`)
- `-DENABLE_OMP=OFF` --- Disable OpenMP
- `-DENABLE_FORTRAN=OFF` --- Disable Compilation of Fortran bindings

> **Note:**
> By default compilation is done using shared libraries. Some systems have linking
> problems with static libraries that have not been compiled with `-fPIC`.
> In this case, also compile atlas using static linking, by adding to step 2:
    `--static`

Runtime Configuration
---------------------

Atlas behaviour can be configured through some environment variables with defaults marked in square brackets

- `ATLAS_INFO=<0|[1]>`  --- Control printing of Atlas standard information
- `ATLAS_DEBUG=<[0]|1>` --- Control printing of Atlas debug information
- `ATLAS_TRACE=<[0]|1>` --- Control printing of Atlas traces (includes timings)
